;; Define cljs wrappers for MathBox js functions
;; See https://github.com/unconed/MathBox.js/tree/legacy for MathBox documentation
;; See mathboxexample.cljs for usage examples

;; Note that requiring cljsjs.mathbox puts a MathBox instance into the top-level
;; namespace, accessible as js/mathBox, as well as making ThreeBox available as
;; js/ThreeBox
;;TODO handle the hash-sign id on this side?
