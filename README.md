# cljs-mathbox

[cljs-mathbox](https://github.com/eggsyntax/cljs-mathbox) is a ClojureScript wrapper for the [MathBox 1](https://github.com/unconed/MathBox.js/tree/legacy) JavaScript mathematical visualization library.

## Overview

[MathBox](https://github.com/unconed/MathBox.js/tree/legacy) is an extremely powerful library for mathematical (and data) visualization in the browser, specializing in interactive, three-dimensional, animated visualizations, created by [Steven Wittens](http://acko.net/about/). It's built on the [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) library, which is built on [WebGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL). You can see a number of impressive MathBox visualizations at the author's website, [acko.net](http://acko.net/).

It should be noted that this library is based on MathBox version 1. MathBox version 2, which will be a very different, more powerful library, and is [nearing completion](http://acko.net/blog/mathbox2/) as of this writing (12/2015). Nevertheless, MathBox 1 is quite powerful in its own right.

For MathBox 1 documentation, see [its repo](https://github.com/unconed/MathBox.js/tree/legacy) (be aware that Mathbox 2 is [hosted elsewhere](https://gitgud.io/unconed/mathbox)). cljs-mathbox is a fairly thin wrapper over the original. It exposes the primitives (platonic, curve, bezier, surface, bezier-surface, vector, grid, axis, viewport, camera), and the major functions (animate, clone, remove, get-props, set-props).

You can see example usage of cljs-mathbox at the accompanying [cljs-mathbox-example](https://github.com/eggsyntax/cljs-mathbox-example). In short: include and require the library, create a mathbox instance, and call functions on it.

Note that you'll need at least one WebGL shader, and this repo [includes one](https://github.com/eggsyntax/cljs-mathbox/blob/master/shaders/snippets.glsl.html).

## Setup

Build your project once in dev mode with the following script and then open `index.html` in your browser.

    ./scripts/build

To auto build your project in dev mode:

    ./script/watch

To start an auto-building Node REPL (requires
[rlwrap](http://utopia.knoware.nl/~hlub/uck/rlwrap/), on OS X
installable via brew):

    ./scripts/repl

To get source map support in the Node REPL:

    lein npm install

To start a browser REPL:

1. Uncomment the following lines in src/cljs_mathbox/core.cljs:
```clojure
;; (defonce conn
;;   (repl/connect "http://localhost:9000/repl"))
```
2. Run `./scripts/brepl`
3. Browse to `http://localhost:9000` (you should see `Hello world!` in the web console)
4. (back to step 3) you should now see the REPL prompt: `cljs.user=>`
5. You may now evaluate ClojureScript statements in the browser context.

For more info using the browser as a REPL environment, see
[this](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/wiki/The-REPL-and-Evaluation-Environments#browser-as-evaluation-environment).

Clean project specific out:

    lein clean

Build a single release artifact with the following script and then open `index_release.html` in your browser.

    ./scripts/release
