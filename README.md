# cljs-mathbox

[cljs-mathbox](https://github.com/eggsyntax/cljs-mathbox) is a ClojureScript wrapper for the [MathBox 1](https://github.com/unconed/MathBox.js/tree/legacy) JavaScript mathematical visualization library.

## Overview

NOTE: This library is a thin wrapper. 99% of the documentation is on the [MathBox](https://github.com/unconed/MathBox.js/tree/legacy) page.

[MathBox](https://github.com/unconed/MathBox.js/tree/legacy) is an extremely powerful library for mathematical (and data) visualization in the browser, specializing in interactive, three-dimensional, animated visualizations, created by [Steven Wittens](http://acko.net/about/). It's built on the [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) library, which is built on [WebGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL). You can see a number of impressive MathBox visualizations at the author's website, [acko.net](http://acko.net/).

It should be noted that this library is based on MathBox version 1. MathBox version 2, which will be a very different, more powerful library, and is [nearing completion](http://acko.net/blog/mathbox2/) as of this writing (12/2015). Nevertheless, MathBox 1 is quite powerful in its own right.

For MathBox 1 documentation, see [its repo](https://github.com/unconed/MathBox.js/tree/legacy) (be aware that Mathbox 2 is [hosted elsewhere](https://gitgud.io/unconed/mathbox)). cljs-mathbox is a fairly thin wrapper over the original. It exposes the primitives (platonic, curve, bezier, surface, bezier-surface, vector, grid, axis, viewport, camera), and the major functions (animate, clone, remove, get-props, set-props).

You can see example usage of cljs-mathbox at the accompanying [cljs-mathbox-example](https://github.com/eggsyntax/cljs-mathbox-example). In short: include and require the library, create a mathbox instance, and call functions on it.

NOTE that you'll need at least one WebGL shader, and this repo [includes one](https://github.com/eggsyntax/cljs-mathbox/blob/master/shaders/snippets.glsl.html).

NOTE: when you load a cljs-mathbox visualization, you'll see a string of errors like "WebGL: INVALID_OPERATION: getUniformLocation: program not linked". This is a MathBox issue (related to the Three.js dependency), so cljs-mathbox is stuck with it.

## Library usage

Add the following dependency: `[cljs-mathbox "0.1.2-SNAPSHOT"]`
and then you can `(:require [cljs-mathbox.mathbox])`.

Simple example:

```clojurescript
(ns cljs-mathbox-example.core
  (:require [cljs-mathbox.mathbox :as mb]
            [cljs.core.async :refer [<! timeout]])
  (:require-macros [cljs.core.async.macros :refer [go]]))
(let [m (mb/create-mathbox "shaders/snippets.glsl.html" {} "mathboxdiv")]
  (go (<! (timeout 200))
      (-> m
          (mb/camera {:orbit 7.5})
          (mb/platonic {:type :cube
                        :id "acube"})
          (mb/animate "#acube"
                      {:mathRotation [0 3 0]}
                      {:duration 6000}))))
```
## Building this project:

NOTE: typically there's no need to build this project yourself unless you're intending to contribute to cljs-mathbox.

Build your project once in dev mode with the following script and then open `index.html` in your browser.

    ./scripts/build

To auto build your project in dev mode:

    ./script/watch

Build a single release artifact with the following script and then open `index_release.html` in your browser.

    ./scripts/release

The project is based on the [mies template](https://github.com/swannodette/mies) and further information can be found on its page.
